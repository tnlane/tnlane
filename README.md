- 👋 Hi, I’m Tressa
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that allows me to use the creative part of my brain. I am an analytical person by nature but i find crafting and calligraphy to be a way to relax and center myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, Github, cloud engineering and all things TECH that i can soak up. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I am just trying to get my footing in an industry i have been intersted in since i was a kid. I love having skills in multiple areas. I used to code and build websites when i was 13 and i lost the skill from not using it. I was a nurse, i worked in finance, in sales and now im looking for a job in TECH and real estate.
